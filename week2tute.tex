\begin{topic}{Who are you?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Degree?
\item Masters?
\item Year?
\end{itemize}
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{Who am I?}
\begin{itemize}
\item I'm Brae!
\item You may have had me as a CSSE1001 tutor over the last few semesters
\item Third year computer science student
\item I might bring treats (mainly for myself)
\end{itemize}
Have questions specifically for me? b.webb@uq.edu.au\\

\begin{topic}{Welcome to CSSE2002}
What should I expect from this course?

\begin{itemize}
\begin{subtopic}{2-}
\item To learn the basics of java
\end{subtopic}
\begin{subtopic}{3-}
\item To learn some ways to ease complexity of large projects, including:
\end{subtopic}
\begin{subtopic}{3-}
\item documentation and program specifications
\end{subtopic}
\begin{subtopic}{4-}
\item inheritance and programming patterns
\end{subtopic}
\begin{subtopic}{5-}
\item debugging programs
\end{subtopic}
\begin{subtopic}{6-}
\item Three interconnected assignments coded in java
\end{subtopic}
\end{itemize}

\begin{subtopic}{3}
Large projects get complex fast!

This course will teach some techniques for reducing complexity such as documentation and program specifications.

Documentation and program specification minimises the amount of code any one programmer needs to understand and remember.
\end{subtopic}

\begin{subtopic}{5}
How do you find discover what is wrong with a program and where the issue is occuring?

\begin{python}
print("name variable contains", name)
\end{python}

There's a better way!
\end{subtopic}

\begin{subtopic}{6}
This course has three assignments.

Each assignment will build on your previous assignment so make sure it's maintainable.
\end{subtopic}

\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{Hello World Java}
\begin{java}
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
\end{java}
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{Tutorials}
Tutorials are the way we teach most concepts that are tested in the exams (including writing code on paper).

Computers \textbf{should not} be used in tutorials.

This course has the highest failure rate in the faculty - most people fail the exam so tutorials and lectures are important - don't get too focused on assignments
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{Questions}
Implement \texttt{String num(int x)}: which for 0 < x < 10 returns the name of the number, otherwise returns "??".
\begin{itemize}
\item Use a switch statement
\item Use an array of Strings.
\end{itemize}

The Fibbonacci sequence is defined as 1, 1, 2, . . . with F(n) = F(n − 1) + F(n − 2).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute some more terms of the sequence to use for testing.
\item Write int Fib(n)
\item “Desk check” your Implementation.
\end{enumerate}
\end{topic}
